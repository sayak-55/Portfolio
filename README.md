🛠️ Skills
I work with a versatile tech stack that covers both frontend and backend development. On the backend, I use Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, and Firebase to build powerful and scalable applications. For the frontend, I’m skilled in React.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Sass, Material UI, and Chakra UI to create responsive, modern interfaces.
I'm also familiar with languages like Java, Python, PHP, C, and C++, and I use tools like Git, GitHub, Postman, Netlify, and VS Code to streamline development and collaboration.
